                  <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I fell in love with coding while searching for what I want my career to be. I was looking at law, political science analyst and a proffesor of the English language. I came to the relization that I love learning new things and creating them. That is why i turned into a developer. The idea of problem soilvinng while contuning to learn new things like languages or better source code enthralls my mind. I constanly have to consume information and learning about tech has always been a passion of mine. I decided that it was the career for me</p>
